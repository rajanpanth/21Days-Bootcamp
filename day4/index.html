                    <h2>Welcome To Our Site</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I am Ben Carling, the owner and head coach at Sports Performance Services Ltd, based in Douglas,
                        Isle of Man. After studying business management, I decided embark in a career that was also a
                        passion of mine; health and fitness. I had played sports from an early age so it seemed a natural
                        thing to do. I became a qualified Personal Trainer, and latterly an accredited Strength and
                        Conditioning coach with the UKSCA. Currently there are only 4 accredited coaches in the Isle of Man,
                        and circa 600 in the UK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As well as private work, I work at the Isle of Man Sport Institute. I work with a wide cross section
                        of athletes from different sports, from field based sports such as football, rugby and hockey to
                        individual sports such as archery, sailing, tennis, motorsport and swimming. I am proud to have
                        played my part in helping these athletes set personal bests, Island records and some that have gone
                        on to achieve scholarships or youth contracts at professional level
                    </p>
                    <br>
